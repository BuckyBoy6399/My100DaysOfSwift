## Project 8 - HackingWithSwift - 100DaysOfSwift Challenge

**Project 8 - Day One - Day 36 of 100DaysOfSwift**

> Talk is cheap, show me the code. - Linus Torvalds

Today I did (TextAlignment, UIFont, Layout Margins):

- Setting up the project in Xcode
- Created the User Interface entirely programmatically using AutoLayout

**Project 8 - Day Two - Day 37 of 100DaysOfSwift**

> Always code as if the person who ends up maintaining your code will be a violent psychopath who knows where you live. - John Woods

Today I did (adding targets to button, joining/seperating strings, hiding views):

- Loading the level via a text file and adding button targets
- It's play time using the ```firstIndex(of: )``` and ```joined()``` method
- Using property observer method ```didSet```
