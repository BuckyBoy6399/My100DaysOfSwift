## Project 29 - HackingWithSwift - 100DaysOfSwift Challenge

**Project 29 - Day One - Day 94 of 100DaysOfSwift**

> Don’t practice until you get it right; practice until you can’t get it wrong. - Anonymous

Today I did(SKView, Connecting SpriteKit and UIKit):

- Setting up the project in Xcode
- Creating the Building Nodes using SKTextures and CoreGraphics Paths
- Integrating UIKit and SpriteKit Together

**Project 29 - Day Two - Day 95 of 100DaysOfSwift**

> All of physics is either impossible or trivial: it is impossible until you understand it, and then it becomes trivial. - Ernest Rutherford

Today I did(SKTransitions, Working with Mathematics and Physics):

- Creating and launching bananas using Texture Atlases
- Presenting new game scenes using SKTransitions

**Project 29 - Day Three - Day 96 of 100DaysOfSwift**

> People sometimes have a view of programming that is something solitary and very technical, but programming is among the most creative, expressive, and social careers. - Craig Federighi

Today I completed the challenges:

- Adding code and UI to track the player scores across levels, then make the game end after one player has won three times.
- Adding Auto Layout rules
- Using physics world gravity and wind changing property for changing direction and strength of the banana vector

**Project 29 - Summary**

I learnt about:

- SKView
- Connecting SpriteKit and UIKit
- SKTransitions
- Working with Mathematics and Physics
