> We don’t want to carry around a mouse, right? So what are we going to do? Oh, a stylus, right? We’re going to use a stylus. No! Who wants a stylus? You have to get them and put them away, and you lose them – yuck. Nobody wants a stylus, so we’re not going to use a stylus. We’re going to use the best pointing device in the world. We’re going to use a pointing device we’re all born with, we’re born with ten of them – we’re going to use our fingers. - Steve Jobs
