## Project 26 - HackingWithSwift - 100DaysOfSwift Challenge

**Project 26 - Day One - Day 85 of 100DaysOfSwift**

> Personal computers have evolved in an office environment in which you sit on your butt, moving only your fingers, entering and receiving information censored by your conscious mind. That is not your whole life, and probably not even the best part – we need to think about computers that sense more of your body, serve you in more places, and convey the physical expression in addition to information. - Dan O’Sullivan

Today I did (fatalError(), SKAction, Enums):

- Setting up the project in Xcode
- Loading level from a text file using CategoryBitMask, CollisionBitMask, ContactTestBitMask physics body

**Project 26 - Day Two - Day 86 of 100DaysOfSwift**

> It’s true: when something exceeds your ability to understand how it works, it sort of becomes magical – and that’s exactly what the iPad is. - Jony Ive

Today I did(Combining bitmasks using ```|```,  SKAction sequences, CoreMotion, compiler preprocessors):

- Tilting to move using CoreMotionManager
- Contacting with the vortex, stars and finish line

**Project 26 - Day Three - Day 87 of 100DaysOfSwift**

> Surprise and delight and connection are remarkable. - Seth Godin

Today I completed the challenges:

- Refactoring the ```loadLevel()```
- Adding and loading different levels
- Adding teleports to reach from one position to another

**Project 26 - Summary**

I learnt about:

- CoreMotion
- Compiler Preprocessors
- SKAction sequences
- Combining bitmasks using ```|```
- fatalError()
- UInt32
