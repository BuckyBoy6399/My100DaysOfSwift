## Project 26 - HackingWithSwift - 100DaysOfSwift Challenge

**Project 26 - Day One - Day 85 of 100DaysOfSwift**

> Personal computers have evolved in an office environment in which you sit on your butt, moving only your fingers, entering and receiving information censored by your conscious mind. That is not your whole life, and probably not even the best part – we need to think about computers that sense more of your body, serve you in more places, and convey the physical expression in addition to information. - Dan O’Sullivan

Today I did (fatalError(), SKAction, Enums):

- Setting up the project in Xcode
- Loading level from a text file using CategoryBitMask, CollisionBitMask, ContactTestBitMask physics body
