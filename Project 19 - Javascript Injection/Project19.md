> What I knew was I liked math and science, and I never wanted to memorize everything â€“ I wanted to understand where it came from. - Ginni Rometty

Today I did (NSExtensionItem):

- Setting up the project in Xcode
- Making a shell app
- Adding an Extension File and setting target
- Setting in the .plist of Extension and adding a Javascript Custom Method
