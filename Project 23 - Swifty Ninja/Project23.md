## Project 23 - HackingWithSwift - 100DaysOfSwift Challenge

**Project 23 - Day One - Day 77 of 100DaysOfSwift**

> Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts. - Winston Churchill

Today I did (SKShapeNode, UIBezierPath, touchesEnded(), AVAudioPlayer):

- Setting up the Project in Xcode
- Making the slice with help of SKShapeNode
- Creating Slice Effects with the help of cgPath and UIBezierPath
- Creating the enemy and the sound effects using AVAudioPlayer

**Project 23 - Day Two - Day 78 of 100DaysOfSwift**

> The most certain way to succeed is always to try just one more time. - Thomas Edison

Today I did (CaseIterable, SKTexture, DispatchQueue.Main.AsyncAfter):

- Creating sequence for tossing enemies and bombs using CaseIterable
- Creating methods to slice the enemies and score points
- Creating and destroying player lives using SKTexture

**Project 23 - Day Three - Day 79 of 100DaysOfSwift**

> To create a new standard, you have to be up for that challenge and really enjoy it. - Shigeru Miyamoto

Today I completed the challenges:

- Added anothe sequence case to the enum to toss enemies at a faster speed and score more points when striking it.
- Made the magic numbers as the constant properties of the classes
- Added a Game Over Label

**Project 23 - Summary**

I learnt about:

- CaseIterable
- AVAudioPlayer
- SKShapeNode
- Physics Speed
- removeFirst
- Action Groups and Sequence
