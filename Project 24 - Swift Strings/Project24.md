Today I did (NSAttributedString, Extensions of Strings):

- Setting up the project in Xcode
- Reading a String Element like an Array Element
- Working on String Extensions (```hasPrefix```, ```hasSuffix```, ```deletingPrefix```, ```deletingSuffix```, ```capitalizedFirst```,  ```contains(where: )```)
- NSAttributedStrings

**Project 24 - Day Two - Day 81 of 100DaysOfSwift**

> People ignore design that ignores people. - Frank Chimero

Today I completed the challenges: 

- Creating Extension: a withPrefix method, add prefix to a string and return itself if the string has that prefix
- Creating Extension: a isNumeric property checks that a String contains a numeric and returning a Bool\
- Creating Extension: a lines property to array of lines in a string
