Today I did (NSAttributedString, Extensions of Strings):

- Setting up the project in Xcode
- Reading a String Element like an Array Element
- Working on String Extensions (```hasPrefix```, ```hasSuffix```, ```deletingPrefix```, ```deletingSuffix```, ```capitalizedFirst```,  ```contains(where: )```)
- NSAttributedStrings
