## Project 11 - HackingWithSwift - 100DaysOfSwift Challenge

**Project 11 - Day One - Day 45 of 100DaysOfSwift**

> Iâ€™ve missed more than 9000 shots in my career. I've lost almost 300 games. 26 times, I've been trusted to take the game winning shot and missed. I've failed over and over and over again in my life. And that is why I succeed. - Michael Jordan

Today I did (SKSpriteNode, SKPhysicsBody, SpriteKit):

- Setting up the project in Xcode 
- Creating a SKSpriteNode using UITouch and SKPhysicsBody
- Creating bouncing balls and static physics body

**Project 11 - Day Two - Day 46 of 100DaysOfSwift**

> In the beginning there was nothing, which exploded. - Terry Pratchett

Today I did (SKAction, SKPhysicsContactDelegate, SKLabelNode):

- Creating spinning slots using SKAction
- Collision detection: SKPhysicsContactDelegate
- Scores and obstacles on the board using SKLabelNode

**Project 11 - Day Three - Day 47 of 100DaysOfSwift**

> Nobody challenges me - I challenge myself. - Shakuntala Devi

Today I did (SKEmitterNode):

- Applied the SKEmitterNode effect using the Particles Graphical Editor

Today I completed the Challanges:

- Dropping different ball colours instead of one
- Dropping balls from a restricted position 
- Clearing obstacles if the balls left are none
