**Project 11 - Day One - Day 45 of 100DaysOfSwift**

> Iâ€™ve missed more than 9000 shots in my career. I've lost almost 300 games. 26 times, I've been trusted to take the game winning shot and missed. I've failed over and over and over again in my life. And that is why I succeed. - Michael Jordan

Today I did (SKSpriteNode, SKPhysicsBody, SpriteKit):

- Setting up the project in Xcode 
- Creating a SKSpriteNode using UITouch and SKPhysicsBody
- Creating bouncing balls and static physics body

**Project 11 - Day Two - Day 46 of 100DaysOfSwift**

> In the beginning there was nothing, which exploded. - Terry Pratchett

Today I did (SKAction, SKPhysicsContactDelegate, SKLabelNode):

- Creating spinning slots using SKAction
- Collision detection: SKPhysicsContactDelegate
- Scores and obstacles on the board using SKLabelNode
