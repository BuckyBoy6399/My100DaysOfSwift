## Project 28 - HackingWithSwift - 100DaysOfSwift Challenge

**Project 28 - Day One - Day 92 of 100DaysOfSwift**

> If you think technology can solve your security problems, then you don't understand the problems and you don't understand the technology. - Bruce Schneier

> Cryptography is hard, and simply using AES in a product does not magically make it secure. - Bruce Schneier

Today I did (UITextView, NotificationCentre, KeyChain, LocalAuthentication and FaceID Authentication):

- Setting up the project in Xcode
- Creating the basic text editor using UITextView and NotificationCentre for keyboard events
- Saving data using KeyChainWrapper Classes
- Embedding the FaceID using the Local Authentication Framework

> The online truly secure system is one that is powered off, cast in a block of concrete and sealed in a lead-lined room with armed guards. - Gene Spafford

Today I completed the challenges:

- Adding a Done bar button item, which would hide and lock the secret content
- Adding Password System in the app to make it more secured
- Adding Biometric Authentication in Project 10 - NameToFaces

**Project 28 - Summary**

I learnt about:

- UITextView
- NotificationCentre
