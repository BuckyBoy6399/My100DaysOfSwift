Today I did (UITextView, NotificationCentre, KeyChain, LocalAuthentication and FaceID Authentication):

- Setting up the project in Xcode
- Creating the basic text editor using UITextView and NotificationCentre for keyboard events
- Saving data using KeyChainWrapper Classes
- Embedding the FaceID using the Local Authentication Framework
